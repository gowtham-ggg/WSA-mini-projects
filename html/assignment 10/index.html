                <strong>The Rise of AI in Everyday Applications:</strong> 
                Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer limited to research labs or tech companies; it's becoming a vital part of daily life. From AI-powered virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to AI-driven innovations in healthcare, education, and finance, the technology is evolving rapidly.

                        <strong>AI Cannot Replace Humans:</strong> 
                        While AI is transforming industries with automation and smart decision-making, it cannot fully replace human creativity, empathy, and critical thinking. Human intuition, emotional intelligence, and ethical judgment remain irreplaceable, as AI lacks the capacity for deep understanding and moral reasoning.
